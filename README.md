# Personal Web Site

One of the classes I have taken at University of St. Thomas is Web Development. In this class we were taught
the process and in workings of how a web application worked, both front and back end. In the beginning of
the semester students were tasked with making a website. The website could be anything, so I decided to make
a personal website that acted as a resume.

This website includes a few HTML pages as well as CSS. The HTML pages included an outline to the pages I 
wanted to include such as a resume page, bio page, and a projects page. Each of these pages have information 
and pages that pertain to what the website is about. For example, the bio page has a link to my LinkedIn 
because it includes more information on my background. As mentioned before this project also has a CSS page. 
This page's function was to achieve a similar look across all different pages. By look I refer to text sizes, 
formatting, and color scheme.

Although I am done with this project, this is the type of project that will include future changes. Future
changes such as adding certain functionality to the web site. If there are things to add onto my resume then
that means there are things to change to the website.
